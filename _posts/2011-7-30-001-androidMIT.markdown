We have a very special guest hanging at the studio this week - Guy Hoffman - MIT Alum, amazing technologist+musician+artist (<a href="http://web.media.mit.edu/~guy/">http://web.media.mit.edu/~guy/</a>), and the creator of the popular android C25K app (<a href="https://sites.google.com/site/c25kapp/">https://sites.google.com/site/c25kapp/</a>). 

He's agreed to do a 'Getting started with Android' workshop this Saturday. Basically how to set up your OSX to develop and deploy android apps, and a few hello-worlds. 

*Prerequisites:* Web browser.
