This workshop covers a wide variety of topics to level up your
ClojureScript expertise. We will cover details of compiler, as well
how to navigate the integration with Closure Compiler. We'll show you
how to compose a unified Clojure/ClojureScript workflow. Expect to
come with a enough knowledge to both contribute meaningfully to the
ClojureScript project as well as simplify your own development
process.
