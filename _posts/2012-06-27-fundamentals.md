With Tedb0t
 
You've dabbled with web pages and static web sites.  You've uploaded
files with FTP and maybe configured Apache, perhaps written a PHP
script or two.  But, you wonder, how do modern web applications work?
What concepts underlie the plethora of web app frameworks like Rails
and Django and Tornado, and how do we navigate their many options?

This workshop will cover the foundational concepts that give rise to
all web applications, regardless of language and framework, from the
ground up: what is a server, really - and for that matter, what is a web
application?  How do databases integrate into my app, and how do I
deploy it to the world?  How do networks of computers communicate,
process and display the information that comprise the Facebooks,
Gmails and Pinterests of the world?  No matter how you program them,
they all "REST"* on the same core ideas.

We'll walk through a simple example application in Python and deploy
it, live, to Heroku (a fast and easy way to get your app online).
Programming and terminal experience is recommended, but even without
it, you will become familiarized with the foundations of web
application development and leave the class with a working site that
you can grow and modify.
 
\*A pun that you'll get if you attend this class!
 
# About Kitchen Table Coders:
 
Hi, we're David, Amit, Ted, Tims & Jeff. We design software & hardware
for a living and share a studio in Brooklyn. We're ever curious about
new and old languages, as well as the people who shaped
them. Sometimes we teach graduate courses, so we figured why not do
informal workshops at our studio with like-minded folk.  Every week we
host a workshop on a topic we're passionate about. We keep it down to
6 people because that's how many fit around our kitchen table. There's
no projector. We just hang out for the day, and enjoy a collaborative
learning experience.  Check out our previous workshops or more info!
