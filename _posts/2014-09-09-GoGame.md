Come join us in our Brooklyn studio for a relaxed evening of learning
how to play Go - the ancient board game. Between games we often chat
about whatever suits our fancy from programming languages to logic,
art, music and more. No experience in any of the above required :)
Bring your boards or your laptops and tablets with a Go client
installed!
