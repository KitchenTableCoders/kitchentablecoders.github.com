This workshop is designed to get you up and running with ClojureScript
as quickly as possible. We will cover the language essentials,
REPL-driven development, and building single page applications using
Reagent, a popular React binding for ClojureScript. We'll become
familiar with the new cli tools and see how they deliver many
modern affordances like hot-code reloading, and enhanced REPL
capability without adding significant complexity to the prjoect.
