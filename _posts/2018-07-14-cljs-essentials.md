This workshop is designed to get you up and running with ClojureScript
as quickly as possible. We will cover the language essentials,
REPL-driven development, and building single page applications (SPAs) with
Reagent, a popular React binding for ClojureScript. We'll become
familiar with the new Clojure CLI tools and see how they deliver many
modern affordances like hot-code reloading and enhanced REPL
capability without adding significant complexity to the project. We'll cover
many practical topics including integrating 3rd party JavaScript libraries, 
building production assets, and code splitting and async loading of splits. By
the end of the course you should be able to confidently build a modern SPA using
the latest JavaScript and ClojureScript tools and libraries.
