Wacom tablets are remarkable tools, and effectively the only way to draw on a computer. However, their default plastic surface is unpleasant to draw with and imprecise. We'll explore how to modify a normal Wacom tablet to deliver the texture and precision expected of professional analog drawing tools.

This class will cover:
- How to reversibly modify the plastic tip of a Wacom stylus into a sharpened metal point comparable in feeling to nib pens.
- How to select alternate surfaces for the tablet itself.
- Auxiliary supports for precise curves.
- Software settings and other tips for maximizing gestural control.
