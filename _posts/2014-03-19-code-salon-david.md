###Turning Around: Reflections on Om

In Bret Victor's [fantastic reading roundup for
2013](http://worrydream.com/Links2013/), he comments in the margin
that as developers we often ask the question "How can I do a better
job today?" instead of the asking the question "How can we make a
better tomorrow?". He uses the clever analogy of ants marching along a
particular branch of a tree believing that it goes on forever.

I've built user interfaces in anger with many different technologies,
including AppKit, UIKit, Processing, Flash, OpenGL C++, and various
JavaScript libraries and custom frameworks. Having walked down the
mainstream branch for eight years, I believe there is another
way. While I can't say what the other branches will offer, I'm turning
around and this talk will document my lines of thinking in Om that
reflect this. Hopefully we can collectively squint into the distance
and see what other branches might hope to offer.
