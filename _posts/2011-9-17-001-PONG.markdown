This saturday we'll be doing a very special workshop on ... PONG!

We'll spend the afteroon building a pong game from scratch in
Javascript (via ProcessingJS), and discussing the very basic of coding
and game design while at it.

This is a great opportunity to brush up on some basic coding,
interactive concepts, and learn a bit of game-tuning while at it.
 
Towards the end of the class, we'll take a look at how a multitouch
version of the code can be implemented on mobile devices using
OpenFrameworks.
