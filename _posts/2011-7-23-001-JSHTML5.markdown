What is a variable? What is a for loop? What are functions? What are arrays? This introduction to programming will guide you through these concepts using one of the most interesting and prevalent programming languages today - JavaScript.

By writing simple graphics programs with the HTML5 Canvas tag, we'll learn about some of the most essential aspects of the craft of programming while maintaining a creative mindset.

No experience is required - just bring your laptop and make sure you're running a modern browser (Safari 5, Firefox 3+, Google Chrome, Internet Explorer 9). We'll provide you with a simple HTML file for our experiments.

*Prerequisites:* Web browser.
