Feel confident building a ClojureScript Single Page Application, but still
wondering how all of this works behind the scenes? This workshop will cover a
wide variety of advanced ClojureScript topics designed to significantly level up
your expertise. In the end, ClojureScript is just another Clojure library and
this course is intended to demystify its inner workings. By the end of the
workshop, attendees will have enough knowledge to not only make meaningful
contributions back to the ClojureScript open source project, but also leverage
a host of advanced tips and tricks to simplify and streamline the development
process in existing ClojureScript projects.

The curriculum will include an in-depth exploration of ClojureScript compilation
from ClojureScript source to the generated JavaScript output. We'll then turn
our attention to the Google Closure Compiler and examine in detail advanced
compilation, code splitting, and JavaScript module processing. Finally, we'll dive into the ClojureScript REPL infrastructure and
see how to bend it to our will to simplify and streamline the development
process.

This course is tailored for the experienced Clojure or ClojureScript developer
looking for advanced material with a pragmatic focus.
