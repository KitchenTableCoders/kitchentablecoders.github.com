Node.js and Arduino give creative developers the ability to quickly
prototype and create real-time multi-user experiences.

In this workshop we'll build a basic Node.js server on our laptops and
use WebSockets to build a simple realtime multiuser graphical
environment in a web browser. But we won't stop there - we'll show you
how to hook up sensors and electronics to create physical controls for
multiplayer Pong!

This workshop assumes you have basic familiarity with at least one
programming language.

In order to allow us more time to code, we kindly ask that you arrive
with Node.js installed on your laptop (you'll need to be running a
local server). You can find installers for your operating system here,
