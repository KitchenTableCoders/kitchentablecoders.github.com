Introduction to Arcadia: Live Functional Programming for Video Games

[Arcadia](https://github.com/arcadia-unity/Arcadia) brings the full power and interactive immediacy of performant live functional programming to the [Unity](http://unity3d.com/) game engine and development platform. Unity is the industry-standard tool for building professional-quality video games. [Clojure](http://clojure.org/) is an advanced, deeply expressive functional programming language. Arcadia is their integration, yielding a uniquely fluid, immersive game development experience.

This workshop will provide developers with everything they need to start making games in Arcadia.

We will cover:

- Setting up Arcadia in a new or existing Unity project
- Injecting a live Clojure REPL into a running game
- Manipulating the Unity editor programmatically
- Using Arcadia to inspect and debug existing Unity code
- Working basics of the Unity model, and its relationship to Clojure
- Dependency management for sharing libraries
- Export to desktop games
- Time permitting, a demo of live programming in virtual reality with the Oculus Rift
  
Prerequisites:

- Basic knowledge of elementary functional programming ideas (eg map, filter, reduce)
